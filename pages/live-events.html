                Filming live events is a specialty of Forrest who has done so beginning back in 2008 with his first weddings. Since then, he has filmed live music shows, podcasts, events for SXSW, filming musician interviews for Pickathon, and other special events. Forrest owns multiple cameras, lights and microphones—all the parts required to film your event!

            <p class="sub-page-description" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                Every live event presents its own unique challenges—unpredictable lighting, fast-moving subjects, and the pressure of capturing once-in-a-lifetime moments. With nearly two decades of experience, Forrest has developed an intuitive understanding of how to anticipate key moments and position cameras for maximum impact. Whether it's the first dance at a wedding or the climactic finale of a concert, he knows where to be and when.

            <p class="sub-page-description" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                Forrest's approach to live event filming combines technical expertise with creative storytelling. He doesn't just document what happens—he captures the energy, emotion, and atmosphere that make each event special. From intimate podcast recordings to large-scale festival coverage, his gear and experience scale to match your production needs. Multi-camera setups ensure no angle is missed, while professional audio equipment captures crystal-clear sound that brings the footage to life.
