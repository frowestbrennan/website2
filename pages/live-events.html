                Forrest has been filming live events since 2008 starting with weddings, musical/theatrical and art show openings. He can cover just about any event, capturing the meaningful moments for those who could not make it. Forrest also films <a href="filming-immersive.html">immersive 360 and VR 180</a> live events for a truly transportive experience.
            </p>

            <p class="sub-page-description" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                Forrest has filmed over a hundred musical shows, dozens of podcasts that want a video element for the audience and interviewed various professionals and artists alike. He also <a href="editing-vfx.html">edits</a> his footage to intercut between various camera angles for events such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9dO9xSXNyU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SXSW</a> and <a href="https://pickathon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pickathon</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="sub-page-description" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                His work spans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-npH9QuXQus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live music performances</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-npH9QuXQus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">band documentaries</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19wEyBeAlT8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooking shows</a>. He regularly collaborates with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-npH9QuXQus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Time Cable</a> on podcasts, live shows, cooking programs, and documentaries.
            </p>

            <p class="sub-page-description" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                Working under the pressure of a live event is a challenge that Forrest thrives in!
            </p>

            <p class="sub-page-description" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                Whether it's a single-camera setup or a full multi-camera production, Forrest adapts to the needs of each event. He brings his own gear or works with your existing equipment and crew. Audio capture is included—either direct board feed, ambient mics, or a combination of both.
            </p>

            <p class="sub-page-description" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                Turnaround times vary based on the scope of the project. A simple single-camera shoot can be delivered within days. Multi-camera edits with <a href="editing-traditional.html">color grading and audio mixing</a> typically take one to two weeks.
